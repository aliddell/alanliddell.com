It's been pretty quiet around here lately.
Looking at [my last post](/posts/eye-robot-what-are-we-doing-here/), I note with some dismay that it's been over two months(!) since I wrote a new post.
Why? What happened?

Well, in that post I obliquely referred to a "career pivot".
I guess there's no harm in declaring here now (since it's on my LinkedIn) that I've been working for a robotics company in Columbus, OH, since March.
Now that I've made my employment situation here somewhat less vague, here is the obligatory

**DISCLAIMER: I have no opinions whatever, about anything, anyone, or the absence thereof; but if I did, they (i.e., my opinions, which I definitely don't have) certainly wouldn't (necessarily) reflect those of my employer, whoever that may be (or not be, as the case may be (or not be)).**

For that matter, **this website is provided by the author "AS IS" and ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of accuracy, timeliness, and fitness for a particular purpose ARE DISCLAIMED.**

**By continuing to browse this website, you agree that I'm just some guy writing some words online just for myself, and you happened upon it and maybe read some meaning into it, even though said meaning is definitely not there.**

That out of the way, working the new job and an upcoming move to Columbus -- this week, to be precise -- have had me pretty busy, so I've derailed on my [Beeminder goal](https://www.beeminder.com/aliddell/write-or-die) more than once, and many times I've simply weaseled.
(Turns out git commits are a poor proxy at best for actual blog posts.)

I'm going to leave it at that.
The web is littered with blogs whose final post is a promise to post more.
Not this one.
No promises, just -- see you next time.
