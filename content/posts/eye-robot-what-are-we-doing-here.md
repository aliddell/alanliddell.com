I'm learning computer vision in advance of what I hope to be a career pivot.

In graduate school I worked in [numerical algebraic geometry][wp-nag], which can be boiled down to a collection of numerical algorithms for solving systems of polynomial equations, together with data structures and additional algorithms for describing positive-dimensional (i.e., infinite) solution sets called *varieties*.
(Some algebraic geometers use the term *algebraic set* to describe these solution sets and reserve the term *variety* for strictly irreducible algebraic sets, but, last I checked, the convention among numerical algebraic geometers is to use variety for both cases.)
But in the work that I do now, I don't really have much use for that stuf, which is really too bad because algebraic geometry is so beautiful and NAG is so useful -- polynomial systems are *everywhere*.
