## Note

This post follows along with *Approximation Theory and Approximation Practice*, Ch. 2: **Chebyshev points and interpolants**.
I'm using [Pluto notebooks](https://juliahub.com/docs/Pluto/OJqMt/0.7.4/) for the exposition.

My goal in writing this post is to learn about Chebyshev points and what makes them useful.
