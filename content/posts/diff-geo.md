(Side note: I'm a neophyte in too many things.)
[Source](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~salamon/PREPRINTS/diffgeo.pdf).

The shortest path (on a surface) between two points in that surface is called a *geodesic*.
(Handwave alert: this is almost certainly not true for all types of surfaces.
Also, can we restrict this to open sets or does the term *geodesic* apply to the shortest path over the entire surface?
Also also, using "the" shortest path is fraught unless there is a guarantee of uniqueness.)
