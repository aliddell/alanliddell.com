# About me

My name is Alan and this is my personal site.
I do [software][github] for a living.
My background is in [computational mathematics][gscholar], but I'm no longer active in research.
I have a wife and two boys, and a neutral evil cat (but I repeat myself).

## My interests

### Tech

I like Linux and FreeBSD.
My daily driver is a [System76 Serval WS][serval], which, aside from some hiccups involving the NVIDIA GPU (mostly on Fedora, but I've since reverted to System76's [Pop!\_OS][popos] and had no issues), has been an absolute pleasure to use.

### Music

I usually listen to classical music or jazz at home.
If I really want to concentrate I might put on something more [atmospheric](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_me_VUSOM-q8R9f7EIWEYtDAujpMKq8QgI), even [doomy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aDpCIDYDc8).
I also like band like Ladytron and Massive Attack, and the absolute classics like Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull, or Rush, and I dig [stoner metal](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknVpWR6m2Ijzkqo-aPXs_g) as a style.

I don't get to play much anymore, but at one point I was the bassist for the 1st Marine Division band, and I still have many instruments, most of them stringed, gathering dust.

### Reading

I mostly like to read science fiction.
Right now I'm reading [*The Hydrogen Sonata*][gr-hydrogen] on paper, [*On the Steel Breeze*][gr-steel] as an eBook, and [*The Algebraist*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12009.The_Algebraist) as an audiobook.
I'm also slogging through [*Osman's Dream*][gr-osman], which is a *very* thorough history of the Ottoman Empire.

### Running

In late 2019 and early 2020 (before the pandemic), I ran a couple of 5Ks.
Here's me running a 5K last January, just before the pandemic:

![New Year 2020 5K: I'm in the brown shirt and shorts with the #475 bib.](/images/ny5k.jpg)

I quite enjoy racing, even if my times are about average for my age group.
I'd registered for a few more races this past spring, but they were all cancelled (unfortunately, but obviously the correct thing to do).
With no races, I lost the motivation to run and have only done it sporadically since.
The hope is that by mid-fall things will be back to normal, so, inshallah, my next race will be a turkey trot.

Not having run much lately means I have to start from square one: 3 miles a week.
I have a tendency to go too hard in my training and end up hurting myself, so in the next year I plan to add no more than half a mile per week on average, with frequent rest periods.
"There is no hurry. We shall get there some day."

## My goals

My 2021 goals are:

- Run 735 miles ([Beeminder goal](https://www.beeminder.com/aliddell/auto-running)).
(I'll update the [running page](/running) soon with just how I got that number.)
- Reach 25000 XP in Chinese on [Duolingo][duolingo] ([Beeminder goal](https://www.beeminder.com/aliddell/hanyu)).
- Post 52 or more posts to the [blog](/posts) ([Beeminder goal](https://www.beeminder.com/aliddell/write-or-die)).
- Use a Raspberry Pi to power an autonomous robot that can avoid obstacles and perform [SLAM][slam] in an indoor environment.
    - In so doing, become conversant in the methods and applications of [computer vision][computer-vision].
    - Probably also develop a tool to consume and display sensor data coming in off the robot, if I can't find a FOSS alternative.
        - Probably have to learn Qt to accomplish this...

There are some stretch goals, but I'm keeping them back.

### Colophon

The sweet theme is (slightly) modified from Chip Zoller's [Hugo Clarity](clarity). Many thanks, Chip. üôè
