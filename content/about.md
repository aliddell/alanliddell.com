My name is Alan and this is my personal site.
I do [software][github] for a living.
My background is in [computational mathematics][gscholar], but I'm not especially active in research.
I have a wife and two boys, and a neutral evil cat (but I repeat myself).

## My interests

### Mathematics

My training, along with most of my short list of publications, is in numerical algebraic geometry.
I find classical algebraic geometry to be beautiful but almost completely opaque.
My interests have always ~~lay (lain? lie? lien?)~~ been on the computational side, so I emphasize the *numerical* part.
Since I never properly learned Fourier analysis, I want to take a deep dive through approximation theory with Nick Trefethen's [*Approximation Theory and Approximation Practice*][atap].
Trefethen uses [Chebfun][chebfun] for the examples in his book, but I don't have a Matlab license anymore, so I'll try to use [ApproxFun][approxfun].

### Tech

I like Linux.
My personal daily driver is a [System76 Serval WS][serval], which, aside from some hiccups involving the NVIDIA GPU (mostly on Fedora, but I've since reverted to System76's [Pop!\_OS][popos] and had no issues), and the camera hardware, has been an absolute pleasure to use.
At work I use Ubuntu 18.04 on an [Origin](https://www.originpc.com/) which has the same mobo as the Serval, and that's been pretty nice to work with too.

### Music

I usually listen to classical music or jazz at home.
If I really want to concentrate I might put on something more [atmospheric](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_me_VUSOM-q8R9f7EIWEYtDAujpMKq8QgI), even [doomy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aDpCIDYDc8).
I also like band like Ladytron and Massive Attack, and the absolute classics like Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull, or Rush, and I dig [stoner metal](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknVpWR6m2Ijzkqo-aPXs_g) as a style.

I don't get to play much anymore, but at one point I was the bassist for the 1st Marine Division band, and I still have many instruments, most of them stringed, now mostly gathering dust.
When my kids get older, maybe I'll play some more.

### Reading

I mostly like to read science fiction.
Right now I'm reading [*Blue Mars*][gr-blue-mars] in audiobook form.

I write the occasional book review [here](/reviews).
I put off writing a review for *Red Mars* and took a long time to read *Green Mars*, but I'm plowing through *Blue Mars*.
I really don't want to let it all go unreviewed, so my next review will be of the entire trilogy.

### Chess

I play a lot of chess.
It's probably the one thing I do most on my phone.
I have an account on [lichess.org](https://lichess.org/@/corvusossifragus) and one on [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/member/unixbeard941).
For some reason, my Elo ratings are much different between sites.
You should add me and challenge me to a game!

### Running

In late 2019 and early 2020 (before the pandemic), I ran a couple of 5Ks.
Here's me running a 5K last January, just before the pandemic:

![New Year 2020 5K: I'm in the brown shirt and shorts with the #475 bib.](/images/ny5k.jpg)

I quite enjoy racing, even if my times are only about average for my age group.
I'd registered for a few more races in spring 2020, but they were all cancelled (unfortunately, but obviously the correct thing to do).
With no races, I lost the motivation to run and have only done it sporadically since.
The hope is that by mid-fall things will be back to normal, so, inshallah, my next race will be a turkey trot.

Not having run much lately means I have to start from square one: 3 miles a week.
I have a tendency to go too hard in my training and end up hurting myself, so in the next year I plan to add no more than half a mile per week on average, with frequent rest periods.
"There is no hurry. We shall get there some day."

## My goals

My 2021 goals are (modified from their original values after a reality check):

- Run ~~730~~ 435 miles ([Beeminder goal](https://www.beeminder.com/aliddell/auto-running)).
(See the [running page](/running) for a log.)
- Reach ~~25000~~ 30000 XP in Chinese on [Duolingo][duolingo] ([Beeminder goal](https://www.beeminder.com/aliddell/hanyu)).
- Post ~~52~~ 40 or more posts to the [blog](/posts) ([Beeminder goal](https://www.beeminder.com/aliddell/write-or-die)).
- Use a Raspberry Pi to power an autonomous robot that can avoid obstacles and perform [SLAM][slam] in an indoor environment.
    - In so doing, become conversant (or expert) in the methods and applications of [computer vision][computer-vision].
    - In so doing, become conversant (or expert) in [ROS][ros].

There are some stretch goals, but I'm keeping them back.

### Colophon

The sweet theme is (slightly) modified from Chip Zoller's [Hugo Clarity][clarity]. Many thanks, Chip. üôè
